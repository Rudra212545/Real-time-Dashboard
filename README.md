## **Overview**

This repository contains the complete implementation of **both internship technical tasks**:

### **Task 1 — 7-Day Real-Time Micro-Bridge**

A full-stack prototype implementing:

* real-time presence
* action bus
* rule-based agents
* JWT security
* nonce replay protection
* Three.js cube preview
* small job queue
* unified dashboard

### **Task 2 — 4-Day Multi-Agent Orchestrator + Sovereign Sync Layer**

A more advanced extension featuring:

* multi-agent orchestrator
* agent FSMs and priority ordering
* per-agent security (HMAC/RSA, nonce rotation)
* heartbeat validation
* multi-user multi-agent isolation
* final real-time dashboard
* HHG reflection + documentation

These two tasks together simulate the architecture of TTG’s real-world interactive micro-bridge & sovereign-core pipeline.

## **Features**

### **Real-Time Features**

* Multi-user presence (active / idle / disconnected)
* Action bus with real-time logs
* Agent reactions & collisions (spam click → HintAgent priority)
* 3D Cube (Three.js) that updates on job finish
* Real-time job queue (build simulation)

### **Multi-Agent System**

* HintAgent (spam-detection → trigger hint)
* NavAgent (idle → trigger nav prompt)
* PredictAgent (pattern-based heuristics)
* RuleAgent (backup heuristic)
* Orchestrator with priority ordering
* Agent FSM visualization (Idle → Triggered → Cooldown)

### **Sovereign Security**

* JWT with issuer + expiry
* HMAC signatures for actions
* Per-agent key registration
* Nonce rotation per agent
* Anti-replay table
* Secure heartbeats
* Dashboard-level security indicators:

  * Signature failures
  * Replay alerts
  * Nonces
  * Heartbeats

### **UI Panels**

* Presence Panel
* Actions Panel
* Agent Status Panel (FSM)
* Job Queue Panel
* JSON Config Panel
* 3D Cube Preview
* **User Preferences Panel** (compact mode, sound, dark/light)
* Security Panel

## **Setup & Installation**

### **Requirements**

* Node.js 18+
* npm / yarn

### **Clone & Install**

```sh
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd project
```

### **Backend**

```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Frontend**

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:
👉 [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

## **Environment Variables**

Create `backend/.env` with:

```
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
JWT_ISSUER=microbridge.internal
JWT_EXP=1h

# HMAC Keys for agents
HINT_AGENT_SECRET=...
NAV_AGENT_SECRET=...
PREDICT_AGENT_SECRET=...

# anti-replay
NONCE_WINDOW_MS=15000
```

**Do NOT commit your .env file.**

## **How to Use the Dashboard**

### **1. Presence**

Move/stop moving the mouse → active / idle updates automatically
Disconnect tab → disconnected state

### **2. Actions Panel**

Press “inspect”, “interact”, “spam click”, etc.
Watch agent reactions update in real time.

### **3. Agent Panel (FSM)**

Shows:

* state (Idle / Triggered / Cooldown)
* last reason
* last message
* timestamp
* cooldown bar

### **4. Job Queue + Cube Preview**

Submit “generate_world” jobs →
Queue processes →
Cube updates color/size on completion.

### **5. Security Panel**

Shows:

* signature validation results
* per-agent nonce
* replay alerts
* heartbeat status

### **6. User Preferences**

Toggle:

* compact mode
* dark/light
* sound

Preferences persist via localStorage.

## **Security Checklist**

### **Core Security**

✔ JWT validation (issuer + expiry)
✔ HMAC signatures for actions
✔ Per-agent key registration
✔ Anti-replay nonce table
✔ Reject expired timestamps
✔ Heartbeat validation

### **Transport**

✔ WebSocket handshake auth
✔ Origin-restricted CORS

---

## **What I Learned**

* How to build a real-time system end-to-end (frontend + backend)
* Designing multi-agent orchestration with clear priorities
* Implementing JWT + HMAC + nonce security without breaking real-time flows
* Structuring state for multi-user + multi-agent isolation
* Three.js integration with real-time UI
* Building a professional dashboard with modular components
* Improving debugging discipline using structured logs

---

## **HHG Reflection**

### **Humility**

I underestimated how difficult it would be to combine real-time systems, multi-user state, and multi-agent logic while maintaining correctness. Even simple rules became complex when I had to guarantee no interference between agents, no broken sockets, and no inconsistent UI states.

### **Honesty**

I initially misunderstood how replay protection and signature validation should work in a live WebSocket environment. I thought just attaching a signature was enough, but handling nonce rotation, timestamp windows, and invalidation rules forced me to rethink and study digital signature flows properly.

### **Gratitude**

The mentor notes, embedded learning resources, and structured day-by-day tasks helped me immensely. They guided me whenever I was stuck — especially in areas like agent orchestration, microservice heartbeats, and event-driven architecture. These resources made the entire project achievable.
