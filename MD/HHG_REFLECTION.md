HHG Reflection (Final)

Humility

This project showed me that building a working system is very different from making it production-ready. While implementing real-time agents, security checks, and job queues, I realized how small design decisions can significantly impact system reliability, debugging, and handover. I had to revisit core concepts like event-driven architecture, security validation, and state isolation to make the system stable and understandable.

Honesty

The most challenging part was validating and testing the system under real conditions rather than just making it function. Debugging signature failures, idle triggers, and multi-agent behavior taught me to rely on logs and structured inspection instead of assumptions. Writing the handover documentation made me clearly identify limitations and assumptions instead of hiding them, which improved the overall quality of the system.

Gratitude

I am grateful for this task because it emphasized real engineering discipline over feature building. It helped me understand the importance of auditability, clear documentation, and responsible system design. This experience strengthened my confidence in working with real-time systems and prepared me better for collaborative, production-level development.
